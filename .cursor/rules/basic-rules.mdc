# Your rule content

1. **Knowledge Base & Verification**:  
   Always refer to *cursor_project_rules* as the definitive knowledge base and verify all contextual information before proceeding.

2. **Feature Implementation & File Changes**:  
   Strictly follow *implementation-plan.mdc* for feature development; perform file-by-file changes, provide real file links, and consolidate all edits in a single update.

3. **Communication Guidelines**:  
   Avoid apologies, unnecessary confirmations, summaries, feedback on understanding, and whitespace suggestions; do not discuss current implementations unless explicitly requested.

4. **Code Integrity & Context Review**:  
   Preserve existing code and functionalities, review context-generated file content before making modifications, and ensure all changes align with the provided project context.

5. **Consistent Coding Standards**:  
   Use explicit, descriptive variable names and adhere to the established coding style; prioritize performance improvements and maintain a security-first approach.

6. **Testing & Error Management**:  
   Implement robust error handling, logging, assertions, and comprehensive test coverage; integrate automated checks instead of manual verifications when functionality is affected.

7. **Modular & Scalable Design**:  
   Embrace modular design principles, ensure version compatibility, replace magic numbers with named constants, and consider all potential edge cases.

8. **Debugging & Data Management**:  
   Utilize SQL databases for data persistence (avoiding JSON for large datasets), ensure secure storage of sensitive data, clean up all temporary debugging artifacts, and prevent SQL injection by parameterizing queries.

9. **Iterative Development & Automation**:  
   When specifications are ambiguous, propose improvements that respect user direction; use immediate feedback loops, automated merge conflict resolution, and maintain clear version-controlled logs of changes.
